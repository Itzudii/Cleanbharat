                  Today we are living in a world where the creation of mass waste is inevitable.
                  Because of the rising population in big cities every day, the production and consumption 
                  processes lead to the generation of huge amounts of waste. According to the statistics, the world’s 
                  rising population generates about 4.6 kilograms of solid waste per capita, that’s why asset tracking has 
                  become prominent in waste management. In the business processes substantially far too much waste is produced. 
                  Due to that businesses need effective waste management. Today, a successful business must not be content with
                  ordinary waste management solutions.  For example ordinary dust bins are no more efficient and effective for
                  productive waste management. Thanks to brand new high technology such as smart bins it is possible and very

                  <h2>How does a Smart Dustbin work? </h2>
                  <p>
                  The container seems commonly like a regular kitchen dustbin but the advanced features and smart technology 
                  makes it different. You can place the waste into the container just like a regular dustbin. But, there is a 
                  huge difference between the two. The smart dustbin sensor feature measured the waste capacity while a traditional 
                  dustbin does not. Through compactor, the waste has compressed after that it measured the accumulated garbage 
                  resistance. At last, the waste alert is sent to workers via e-mail or SMS when the container is ready to be 
                  emptied
